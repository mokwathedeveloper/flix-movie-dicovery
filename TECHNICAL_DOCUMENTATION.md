# FLIX Technical Documentation

## Architecture Overview

FLIX is built using a modern React-based architecture with a focus on performance, maintainability, and user experience. The application follows a component-based design pattern with clear separation of concerns between presentation, business logic, and data management.

### Core Architecture Principles

**Component-Based Design**
- Functional components with React Hooks for state management
- Reusable UI components with consistent prop interfaces
- Separation of presentation and business logic
- Error boundaries for graceful error handling

**State Management Strategy**
- React Context API for global application state
- Local component state for UI-specific data
- Custom hooks for complex business logic
- Optimized re-rendering with React.memo and useMemo

**Data Flow Architecture**
- Unidirectional data flow following React patterns
- Service layer for API interactions and data transformation
- Centralized error handling and loading states
- Caching layer for performance optimization
